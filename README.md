*If you have any trouble, please don't hesitate to file an issue, or you can PM my AoPS user account, Printrbot.*

I see that quite a few people have cloned this, and I can't help but wonder if it's even working.
If you have questions of comments, you can post them on the Discussions page, but again, if you have problems getting it to work, please please please file an issue, because you are likely not the first or the last person to have that problem.
Whether posting to let me know how happy you are with it, or how frustrated you are with it, please include you operating system version as that is very helpfull for me to know.
